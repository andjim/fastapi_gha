# Learning GHA and CI Automation with docker
This repo is "vile replication" of Bret Fisher's [docker-ci-automation](https://github.com/BretFisher/docker-ci-automation). It's me following step by step process on how to build a continuos integration workflow, which it's something I've interacted before, but with other tools and not me in the role of a CI workflow builder or maintainer (a simple developer hoping his PR not to fail any tests T.T). It's my first time working with Github Actions, so I'll be detailing the whats,whys, and hows of the workflows I'll be working with to be used for further references to whom might find it insterested (mostly for myself, please go check Bret Fisher's repo).
